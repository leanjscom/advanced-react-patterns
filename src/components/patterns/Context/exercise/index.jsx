      <h4>
        üéØ The goal of this exercise is to use context in some real-world use

      <h4>Exercise part 1, using context for the GraphQL client</h4>
      <p>
        Our current implementation works, but we won't be able to easly write
        tests for our GraphQL queries because the fetching to the API is
        hardcoded.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can solve that by moving the GraphQL data fetching to the context.
        This way we can "inject" the data fetching dependency via context. Just
        like the{" "}

      <h4>Tasks part 1:</h4>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 1.1. Go to{" "}
        <code>
          src/components/patterns/Context/exercise/GraphQLProvider.jsx
        </code>{" "}
        and create a context for the data fetching client. You can call it
        ClientContext.
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 1.2. Add the ClientContext Provider to the
        GraphQLProvider. Should the ClientContext wrap StoreContext? The other
        way around? Does it matter in this case?
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 1.3. Use the client from the context inside
        your useQuery. You can create a handy useClient custom hook like we did
        in the example{" "}
        <code>
          src/components/patterns/Context/example/modal.jsx : useModal function{" "}
        </code>

      <h4>Tasks part 2:</h4>

        In large component trees, an alternative we recommend is to pass down a

        ...If you use context to pass down the state too,{" "}

      <p>ü§î React docs say "use two different context types". Let's do it!</p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 2.1. Create two different context types for
        our StoreContext. One context for the dispatch, and another context for
        the state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 2.2. Great! We've implemented task 2.1. but,
        wait ü§î... does it make any difference in our use case? Why? Discuss
        with your peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't make sense in our case because we are using both dispatch and
        the state from the reducer in the same hook. It would make sense if we
        had two different hooks used in separately in different components in
        the app.
      </p>
      <h4>Tasks part 3:</h4>
      <p>
        <input type="checkbox" /> 3. In{" "}
        <code>
          src/components/patterns/Context/exercise/GraphQLProvider.jsx
        </code>{" "}
        we are using <code>const memoizedHashGql = memoize(hashGql);</code>.
        Should we use useMemo instead? Why?
      </p>
      <p>Answer: React.useMemo would't work for two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When the component unmounts it's not guaranteed the cache will be
          preserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          React.useMemo will only cache the last value, it doesn't keep a record
          of all the queries and variables we might run.
        </li>
      </ol>
